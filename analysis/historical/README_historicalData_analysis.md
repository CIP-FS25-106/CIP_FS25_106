# Historical Train Delay Analysis

This script performs an exploratory analysis of historical train delay data in Switzerland, focusing on three key stations: **Zürich HB**, **Luzern**, and **Genève**.

## What It Does

The script generates a series of visualizations to answer the following questions:

1. Are certain train lines or stations more prone to delays than others?
2. How do delays vary by time of day or day of the week?

## Visualizations Included

- **Overview of delay distribution**
- **Delay breakdown by station and category**
- **Average delay by train category**
- **Bubble chart of frequency vs severity per station**
- **Heatmap of delay percentages by weekday**
- **Line plot of delay percentages by hour of the day**

## How to Run

Ensure the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages installed:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
