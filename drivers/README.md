# Driver Files

This directory contains the chromedriver.exe driver files for Win64, needed for web scraping components using Selenium.

## Chromedriver

The project requires a compatible version of chromedriver.exe for your Chrome browser.

If the included chromedriver doesn't work with your version of Chrome:

1. Check your Chrome version (Help > About Google Chrome)
2. Download the matching chromedriver from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
3. Replace the chromedriver.exe file in this directory
